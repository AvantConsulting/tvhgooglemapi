{"name":"Tvhgooglemapi","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/tvhgooglemapi","body":"### TVHGoogleMapi\r\n\r\nWhen you move to gmail or google apps you can no longer use the build in 'send to mail recipient as attachment' menu option of MS Office and other windows applications without installing a local mail client. The Right click menu of files in explorer Send To -> Mail recipient doesn't work either. Tvhgooglemapi is a simple tool that pretends to be a real mail client to windows but really only uploads the mail to the drafts folder of gmail and then opens the draft in the default webbrowser. For the user this is almost exactly the same as having the gmail web interface as the default mailclient for some windows applications (the only difference being that he has to login twice if he is not already logged in to gmail and doesn't let the tool remember the password.)\r\n\r\n### Also usefull\r\nUsers of this tool will typically want (but do not have) to complement it with google chrome (which can handle mailto links in windows) or something like http://dl.google.com/tag/s/ap=google.com/googlewebapps/en/googleappsstandalonesetuptagged.exe\r\n\r\nBy default tvhgooglemapi will open the draft in a new browser tab/window. If you are using Google Chrome there is an extension that makes sure that only one tab for gmail is open (and also only one for google calendar,...) Using this extension will cause the draft to be opened in the tab where you had gmail open, some people may find that desireable. You can find it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-fixer-for-google-apps/cplbkecindmpapmnffepmnbiogpllcni/details It's support page is here: https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-tab-fixer/wiki/FAQ\r\n\r\n### Readme, please read it\r\nThere are some details you might want to know in the readme: http://tvhgooglemapi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/readme.txt\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThe application can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5rR8r10bVzvQklLN0cxMEFFWXM&usp=sharing#list\r\n\r\n### Support and feedback\r\nThere is no formal support plan, warranty or guarantee the application will work in your environment, but if you do run into issues and we can find some time we may be able to help. As always, test it out in a non critical environment first and sent your first mails to a test address (ie not to customers) to verify everything is working fine.
